Hi And welcome to my repository weary traveler. stay a while and listen...



This Subgraph was deployed to TheGraphNetwork 

Here is the query address: https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/22579/animeversenft/v0.0.1

It index's all transfer events related to the NFT collection. 

This code was constructed using openzepplin and @amxx-graph-protocol software. 

It is meant to be used as an example to others constructing their own subgraphs not as a full program so I will not be leaving redeployment notes.
